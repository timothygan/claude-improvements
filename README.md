Current Landscape (2025)

  Memory & Context Management

  - OpenMemory MCP (Mem0): Local-first persistent memory that works across tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf). Stores context privately on your machine with vector search capabilities.
  - Knowledge Graph Memory MCP: Official implementation for persistent memory using graph structures.

  Chain-of-Thought & Reasoning

  - Sequential Thinking MCP Server: Anthropic's structured reasoning tool with revision tracking, branching paths, and multi-step problem solving.
  - Multi-Agent Sequential Thinking: Advanced MAS implementation using Agno framework for complex reasoning.
  - DeepSeek R-1: Breakthrough in cost reduction ($5.5M training vs hundreds of millions for GPT-4) with strong reasoning capabilities.

  Decision-Making & Agent Frameworks

  - MCP-Agent Framework: Combines MCP with patterns like Evaluator-Optimizer, Orchestrator, and Swarm for production-ready agents.
  - 1000+ Community MCP Servers: Including GitHub, Linear, Sentry, Slack, PostgreSQL, Figma integrations.
  - Remote MCP Support: OAuth-enabled connections without local server management.

  Performance & Cost Optimization

  - Prompt Compression Tools: LLMLingua, PromptOpti - reduce tokens by 30-50%.
  - Caching Systems: GPT-5 cached inputs at $0.125/million tokens, 42% cost reduction reported.
  - Model Cascading: Route simple tasks to cheaper models (GPT-5 Nano at $0.05/million tokens).
